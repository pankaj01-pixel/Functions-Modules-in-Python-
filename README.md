Task 1:

The factorial function can be implemented either iteratively (with a loop) or recursively.

The iterative version initializes result to 1, then multiplies it by each integer from 1 to n.

The recursive version (commented out) uses the mathematical definition of factorial where n! = n Ã— (n-1)! with base case 0! = 1 and 1! = 1.

The function is tested with the number 5, which should output 120.

Task 2:

We import the math module to access mathematical functions.

The program takes a number input from the user (converted to float).

Calculates:

Square root using math.sqrt()

Natural logarithm using math.log()

Sine (in radians) using math.sin()

Results are printed with 4 decimal places for better readability.
